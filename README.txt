Welcome to the source of the Neverhood Restoration Project. We hope you enjoy our sorcery. 
Everything inside of /minimized/ and /necessity/ is native to the Windows machine, so you do not need to install anything to compile/interpret the resources. The /jar/ directory, likely, requires Java to compile but the JAR is set up for you.
The / directory is the main container for all subdirectories.
FUNCTIONS OF THE /:

 Yeah, seriously. I am not a Java programmer at all; Java is simply convenient for this project.

LOGIC:
Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here (sitting there) listening to me (reading what I've written) means you've made a glorious contribution to science. As founder and CEO of Aperture Science (Pyroneous) I thank you for your participation and hope that we can count on you for another round of tests.
Life has never given me any lemons.
Science isn't about why, it's about why not. You ask: why is so much of our science dangerous? I say: why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because you are fired. 

Just a heads up: that coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronic activity in your brain. There's a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe. Anyway, don't stress yourself thinking about it. I'm serious, visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction.
