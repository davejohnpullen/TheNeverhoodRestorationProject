README FILE FOR: /minimized/
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The minimized release is probably the best idea we've yet to have. 
FUNCTIONS OF THE /minimized/:
 - to elevate privileges
 - to download the Neverhood Restoration Project files into itself and running install.bat 
 Note that this source is not actually included into the installation; these files are all packed into an executable file. 
SOURCE(S): 
│   minimized.vbs
 RESOURCE(S):
│   Internet

--------------------------------------------------------------------
LOGIC:
It would be best to explain this through normal formatting rather than a list/flowchart. 
/minimized/minimized.vbs starts by elevating privileges. Next, it uses a function to save the web resources. The resource "install.bat" is started, and normal process found in /necessity/README.txt begins.
